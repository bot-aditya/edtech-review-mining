It is a wastage of time and money. They promise to give every support but once they get the money they stop giving any support. They are playing with the future of the students.

"Initially, Unacademy kept calling me to buy the UPSC course. But once I paid ₹38,000, there was no support at all. No proper customer care, no follow-up. They promised full course access, but later asked ₹14,000 extra for optional. 24/7 mentor support was promised, but now even booking a slot takes a week. My 5 months got wasted. Very disappointing service after payment. After this experience, I will not recommend Unacademy to anyone for UPSC preparation or any other.....",1,PlayStore,Unacademy

The first thing they ask for is full payment of fees, without even allowing students to experience a few classes. But after the payment, the seriousness vanishes. Students",1,PlayStore,Unacademy

Unacademy is ruining by shifting to smart board.The smart board is least interactive and classes dont work properly.Frequent glitches are there. Pen tab was way better and it was the reason i subscripted to uc plus but now its all useless as the classes dont work. A lot of data is consumed in it . All the students want pen tab but i dont understand that why uc isnt listening to anyone. The classes are time wasting and the support doesnt listen to us.

A very good and excellent app but I have given only 4 star rating because the one rating misses in instasolve the experts are copying answers from Google and if they not explained well and we are giving low rating they are scolding me.

All the teachers are teaching good and I love vedantu and their teachers.,4,PlayStore,Vedantu

"PW is excellent only at selling — once they get your money, you’re invisible. I ordered books, got an estimated delivery date, and then… nothing. No tracking, no updates, no real support. Just copy-paste replies and tickets closed without any resolution. They only recognize students before the payment. After that, we’re treated like insects — completely ignored. No calls, no emails, no help. Their so-called “Student Success Team” is a joke. If this is how you treat students preparing for exams",1,PlayStore,PhysicsWallah

"I recently subscribed to this learning platform in Post Graduate Program in Mechanical Engineering and have gone through several of their online saved lectures. The content quality is quite good—well-structured and easy to follow. The flexibility of accessing saved lectures at any time is definitely a plus.

However, I noticed a few areas that need improvement. Firstly, there's no active monitoring or follow-up if a learner misses lectures for a period of time, such as a week. Some level of engagement or reminders could help maintain consistency and motivation.

Secondly, while the platform does offer interview opportunities, I found that the CTC (Cost to Company) for many of these opportunities was actually lower than my current compensation.",1,AppStore,Unacademy

"Unacademy, once hailed as a revolutionary platform for democratizing education, has regrettably taken a turn towards becoming a politically suppressed echo chamber. What was once a promising beacon of knowledge and open dialogue has now succumbed to the pressures of ideological conformity, resulting in a stark departure from its original purpose.

The foundation of Unacademy's success was built upon the principles of accessibility, inclusivity, and the exchange of ideas. However, the recent transformation into a platform that suppresses certain political viewpoints is a betrayal of these core values. By stifling diverse opinions and promoting a singular narrative, Unacademy has effectively undermined the very principles that made it so appealing to learners around the world.

The suppression of political discourse on Unacademy is not only detrimental to intellectual growth but also disheartening for those who seek unbiased information. Education should be about fostering critical thinking skills and encouraging individuals to think independently. By imposing restrictions on political discussions, Unacademy is ironically hindering the very process of learning it once championed.

Furthermore, this shift towards political suppression risks alienating a significant portion of its user base. Unacademy's initial allure was its ability to connect learners from all walks of life, creating a diverse community of individuals hungry for knowledge. However, the platform's current trajectory isolates those who do not conform to the prevailing ideology, further fragmenting an already divided society.

While Unacademy may argue that such measures are taken to maintain a safe and inclusive environment, the consequences are alarming. By suppressing political discourse, the platform is effectively infantilizing its users and preventing them from engaging in meaningful, informed discussions. This not only erodes the credibility of Unacademy as a true educational platform but also impedes personal growth and critical thinking development.

In conclusion, Unacademy's transformation from a learning oasis to a politically suppressed platform is deeply disappointing. The platform's founders and users alike should be concerned about the erosion of intellectual integrity and the stifling of diverse voices. If Unacademy truly wishes to honor its roots and be a beacon of learning, it must reconsider its approach, encourage open discourse, and prioritize the development of well-rounded, informed individuals over the enforcement of a singular political narrative.",1,AppStore,Unacademy

"Dear Developer, 
I want to intend your esteemed self towards a complaint lodged by me here on the subject of ""the working of this application.""
 I had always an impression from the beginning that its an application which can conceptualise each and every material and chapter of our syllabus in a fun manner. However, it is unfortunate to inform you that the application didn't work properly. It shows no live classes and half of the screen remains invisible. Moreover, The screen ratio is only 16:9 (mobile view) and it becomes difficult to view in a landscape manner, especially when you are working with iPad.
 I would be highly obliged if your esteemed self could take this decision as soon as possible in favour of the request made, and would bring in updates by fixing all the bugs and issues made in your script-written programme. 

Hoping to get a response at the earliest.",1,AppStore,Vedantu

"The teaching quality at the offline center of PW has been quite disappointing. The teachers often do not teach in a structured or clear manner. They tend to beat around the bush rather than explaining the concepts directly. Before starting a new topic, they write down questions related to it, solve only a few parts, and then suddenly mention that a certain concept was left unexplained — asking students to go study it on their own. This creates confusion and disrupts the flow of learning. Moreover, their teaching style is often filled with unnecessary jokes and casual behavior, which further dilutes the seriousness of the class.

But most concerning is the clear discrimination shown by some teachers — they behave differently with different students, which creates a very demotivating and unfair learning environment. Such behavior is highly unprofessional and discouraging for sincere students who come with the intent to study seriously.",1,AppStore,PhysicsWallah
"I’ve used many educational platforms, but PW truly stands out from the rest. The quality of education here is unmatched — the concepts are taught in such a simple and effective way that even tough topics start making sense.

One of the best parts of this app is the direct interaction with teachers. You can ask doubts, get answers, and feel like you’re part of a real classroom. The motivation, discipline, and care the teachers show makes it feel personal, not just another online course.

I’ve improved so much since joining PW, and it feels like I’m not alone in my NEET/JEE journey anymore. PW is not just an app — it’s a movement for students who dream big.

Highly recommended for serious aspirants. Thank you, PW team! 💯",5,AppStore,PhysicsWallah

"I really love this app for its clean interface and smooth video playback. One thing I’ve noticed, though, is a bug when using Bluetooth controls at speeds other than 1×:
	1.	Play a video at 1.5× (or 2×) speed.
	2.	Pause using a Bluetooth device (AirPods, headset, etc.).
	3.	Resume with those same Bluetooth controls.

After resuming, the player’s UI still shows 1.5× (or 2×), but the video actually plays at 1×. It feels like the app isn’t remembering and reapplying the custom speed when the play command comes from a Bluetooth device. The ideal behavior would be to keep playing at the chosen speed, not revert to 1×.

A fix could be something along these lines: store the user’s selected playback rate, and whenever a remote “play” event is triggered (e.g., via MPRemoteCommandCenter on iOS), explicitly set player.rate = selectedSpeed right after calling player.play(). That way, the UI and the actual playback rate stay in sync, even if I pause/resume through Bluetooth.

Also: it would be amazing to see higher playback-speed options (up to 4×). Right now most apps cap at 2×, but for quick reviews of long videos (tutorials, lectures, podcasts), having the choice of 2.5×, 3×, 3.5×, or 4× would be a huge time-saver—especially if the audio keeps decent pitch correction so it doesn’t get too distorted.

Thanks for all the hard work on this app! If these two improvements (Bluetooth-playback bug fix + higher-speed options) can be added in a future update, I’ll gladly change my rating to 5 stars.",3,AppStore,PhysicsWallah

"Hello Dev Team,
PW has been bliss in my JEE prep journey. However, I see many bugs in the IOS version of the app. 
1. I usually use Saarthi feature on my iPhone and have trouble uploading questions pics. There is no option to crop the pictures and it is set to a fixed ratio of a square and the question never fits the picture properly. 
2. Also if a wrong question pic is sent then there is no option to delete it. This is troublesome since it is difficult to share the questions with the mentors.
3. The dashboard shows wrong data about completed lectures and sops and the rest of it.
4. There is no option for sharing referral links. I do not find the refer and earn section, neither in my iPhone nor in my windows web version. 
5. The leaderboard and points is also not visible in the IOS version of the app. 
6. While submitting the google form for 1:1 mentorship, it asks for the sign in and when clicked on it, it does nothing and the form is disabled, overall making it impossible to fill the form for mentorship through my phone.

Today also it was same, but I continuously clicked submit button bcoz I know that there are no any prohibited words but worstly I blocked,that not matters for me..Matter is that why I blocked despite being not using any prohibited words.. Why I was getting the warning that you will block….

"PW , ONLY ONE THE BEST FOR COMPETITIVE EXAM .",5,AppStore,PhysicsWallah
"Hi PW Team,

I’ve been using the app extensively and have noticed some issues and potential improvements that could really enhance the experience for students:

1.Community Section Delay: I understand the community section is planned for version 7.0, but having it sooner would be a great benefit for students looking for peer support.

2.Sorting for Downloaded Files: A “Sort by” option (by chapter, date, or size) for downloaded PDFs would be really helpful. This feature would make navigating study materials more efficient.

3.Watchtime Glitch: There’s a glitch where the watchtime counter seems to get stuck every 5 days or after a 5-day streak. I found reinstalling the app temporarily fixes this, but it returns after a while, possibly related to iOS updates.

4.Unable to Delete Downloaded Documents: After deleting downloaded documents, they reappear when I recheck them. Lectures delete without issues, but documents seem to come back, so addressing this would be appreciated.

5.Picture-in-Picture (PiP) Mode for iPad: For iPad users, adding PiP support would be very helpful. Split-screen mode reduces the space available for making notes, so PiP could allow for easier note-taking while watching lectures.

6.Noise Cancellation or White Noise Feature: Many students benefit from studying with white noise or music in the background. Adding this as an in-app feature would help students focus, especially those studying in noisy environments.

7.Timeline Glitch in Lecture Videos: When using the timeline to skip to a slide, the video often lands on the previous slide’s timeline (x-1). Fixing this would allow smoother navigation during lectures.

Overall, these features and fixes would greatly improve the app experience for serious students. 
Thank you for considering these points!",3,AppStore,PhysicsWallah

"I’m writing this review based solely on the app’s performance, not the faculty or course content. While I find the lectures helpful, I often experience issues when trying to access the lecture notes. Every time I attempt to open the notes, the app just shows a loading screen and never fully loads the content. This has made it challenging to review materials, especially when I want to revisit topics after lectures. I hope the developers can address this loading issue in future updates to improve the overall learning experience.",1,AppStore,PhysicsWallah
